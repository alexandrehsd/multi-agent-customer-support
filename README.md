# Multi Agent Customer Support

This repository hosts the code to build a Multi Agent Customer Support application with LangGraph. You can check the whole tutorial in the LangGraph Documentation [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/customer-support/customer-support/).

The idea here is to develop the whole project in order to get a sense on how to develop complex applications with LangGraph.
